# encryption_prog
a Caesar encryption project i was asked to make at school but that i didn't really like
a Caesar Cipher is irrelevant to modern encryption and not at all secure
my friend suggested i implement a one-time-pad which i really enjoyed as it fascinates me how secure it still is and relevant today looking at the challenges of symentric encryption
